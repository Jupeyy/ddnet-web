There were a lot of reports about for bugs and crashes with intel processors under Windows lately.

It might have been created by a windows update, which also updates the intel GPU's driver.

A driver update seemed to help with this situation (downloaded the latest driver for intel and update it with help of [this](//https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-Yoga-Series-Notebooks/Update-to-Latest-Intel-Graphics-Driver/m-p/4457633?page=1#4457786))

We hope that intel can solve their issue quickly, until then you can just try to follow the advice above.
