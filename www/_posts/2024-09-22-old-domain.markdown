  <h2 id="compromised-domain-notice">DDNet.tw Domain lost, use DDNet.org</h2>
  <p>Recently, we lost control of the domain <strong>ddnet.tw</strong> due to a botched transfer between registrars. Older clients (pre 16.4) rely on this domain for info, maps, updates, and more, meaning they are no longer safe to use.</p>
  <p>A former community member has managed to buy the expired domain. Unfortunately, they refuse to return it, forcing us to discontinue support for these older clients.</p>
  <p>While we have monitored the situation and have not observed any malicious activity yet, we can't guarantee this will remain the case, and we don't want to take unnecessary risks.</p>
  <h3>What to do:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the "update" button in the client, as this could compromise your system.</li>
    <li><a href="/downloads/">Download</a> a fresh copy of the client from our website.</li>
    <li>Avoid clicking or using links from <strong>ddnet.tw</strong>.</li>
    <li>Fix or report places where the <strong>ddnet.tw</strong> domain is used instead of <strong>ddnet.org</strong> on our <a href="/discord">Discord</a>.
  </ul>
  <p>If the domain is returned to us in the future, we may be able to restore functionality for these old versions. Until then, these clients will remain banned on <strong>DDNet</strong> servers.</p>
