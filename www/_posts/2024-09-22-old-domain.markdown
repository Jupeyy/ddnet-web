<h2 id="compromised-domain-notice">DDNet.tw Domain lost, use DDNet.org</h2>
<p><s>Recently, we lost control of the domain <strong>ddnet.tw</strong> due to a botched transfer between registrars. Older clients (pre 16.4) rely on this domain for info, maps, updates, and more, meaning they are no longer safe to use.</s></p>
<p><s>A former community member has managed to buy the expired domain. Unfortunately, they refuse to return it, forcing us to discontinue support for these older clients.</s></p>
<p><s>While we have monitored the situation and have not observed any malicious activity yet, we can't guarantee this will remain the case, and we don't want to take unnecessary risks.</s></p>
<h3><s>What to do:</s></h3>
<ul>
  <li><s>Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the "update" button in the client, as this could compromise your system.</s></li>
  <li><s><a href="/downloads/">Download</a> a fresh copy of the client from our website.</s></li>
  <li><s>Avoid clicking or using links from <strong>ddnet.tw</strong>.</s></li>
  <li><s>Fix or report places where the <strong>ddnet.tw</strong> domain is used instead of <strong>ddnet.org</strong> on our <a href="/discord">Discord</a>.</s></li>
</ul>
<p><s>If the domain is returned to us in the future, we may be able to restore functionality for these old versions. Until then, these clients will remain banned on <strong>DDNet</strong> servers.</s></p>
<h3>UPDATE:</h3>
<p>The person who took over the DDNet.tw domain was <strong>SP | Someone</strong>. His goal was to make sure old clients keep working. He has graciously returned the domain to us without even accepting payment, so old clients will work again! Thank you <strong>SP | Someone!</strong></p>
